# Hello, I'm Felipe Reis 👋

> "I have a natural and innate curiosity; knowledge is always welcome."

I am a **Material Engineering** student at **POLI-USP** and an **Electronics Technician** (ETEC graduate). My career began with vital experiences in robotics and engineering, and today I work as a programmer and engineer, having gained professional experience with **Python**, **Embedded Systems** and **Robotics**.

I am a curious, self-taught individual, fluent in English, and always expanding my skill set—whether in languages like **C++** and **JavaScript** or in **Visual Communication Design**.
